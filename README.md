The "Trema" Moodle Theme
============================
![theme-trema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8494871/150807318-57548da5-ea15-45a3-98d9-170f8495b95b.gif)
The theme trema is focused in usability and beauty.
In order to acheive this, our developers worked hard to
make it clean and easy to use for everyone.

The main goal for this theme is that the Moodle site will not need
another site for information/advertising/marketing.

Nice features in trema:
 - It's based in the boost theme, so it will continue to be compatible with Moodle 
 for a long time.
 - The frontpage is fully customized. It's possible to change the image 
 banner. You can create up to six beautiful cards with custom contents and
 you can add custom HTML content with no restrictions.
 - The login page is awesome with [Particles lib](https://github.com/mmacheerpuppy/particles.js).
 - We really use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make the theme fully responsive.
 - The footer is highly customizable and we have an exclusive admin area 
 block that can be seen and accessed only by the site administrator.
 - Thinking a little more about the administrators we made the admin 
 dashboard area, so that they can see in real time some data about their Moodle.
  - The colours scheme can be changed in the theme settings.
