# Basic Overview

The Trema theme is a free, responsive Moodle theme that offers a clean and modern design. One unique aspect of the Trema theme is its ability to display course information in a grid format, which can be particularly useful for sites with many courses. Additionally, it includes options for a customizable frontpage, login page, and footer. Overall, the Trema theme for Moodle aims to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for Moodle users.

# Requirements

This theme requires Moodle LMS 4.0+ from https://moodle.org/.

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Download Trema for Moodle LMS

The most recent STABLE release of Trema for Moodle LMS is available from:
https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_trema

The most recent DEVELOPMENT release can be found at:
https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Installation

Ensure you have a supported version of Moodle LMS as stated above in [Requirements](#requirements). This is necessary as the theme relies on underlying core code.

Install the theme, like any other theme, to the following folder:

    /theme/trema

See https://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins.

To activate the theme, navigate to **Site Administration > Appearance > Themes (section) > Theme selector**. In recent versions of Moodle LMS, you need only locate the Trema theme and click the associated **Use Theme** button.

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Usage

IMPORTANT: This STABLE release has been tested on many Moodle sites. Although we expect everything to work, if you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema/issues).

You can customize the theme by navigating to **Site Administration > Appearance > Themes (section) > Trema**

In addition, you can customize additional settings by overriding SCSS variables in the theme's settings. [See the complete list](https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema/blob/dev/scss/defaultvariables.scss).

# Updating

There are no special considerations required for updating the plugin.

Note: The theme will not be upgradable from within Moodle LMS if you installed it using Git. To enable upgrading, simply delete the .git folder in the /theme/trema/ directory.

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Uninstallation

Before you can uninstall Trema, be sure to switch to a different theme.

Then uninstall the theme by navigating to Site Administration > Plugins > Plugins (section) > Plugins Overview. Scroll down to the **Themes** section and Uninstall. If you don't see the uninstall link, it is because you did not first switch Moodle LMS to a different theme. Follow the prompts to complete the uninstallation process. Note that you may also need to manually delete the following folder if your web server does not have the required permissions:

    /theme/trema

Note that, once uninstalled, any customizations that were part of the Trema theme will no longer be displayed.

# FAQ
## Answers to Frequently Asked Questions

IMPORTANT: Although we expect everything to work, this release has not been fully tested in every possible situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema/issues).

### What can I override in Trema's Raw Initial SCSS settings?

<strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to include trailing semi-colons or Moodle will break the theme's CSS. Example:

Bad:

    $banner-text-color: #462323

Good:

    $banner-text-color: #462323;

| Description                         | SCSS variable        | Default                        | Sample value |
|:------------------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------|
| Text color of the frontpage banner. | $banner-font-color   | $white                         | #462323      |
| Set scale of site name font size.   | $sitename-font-scale | 1 (site name > 36 chars: 0.75) | 0.8          |
| Height of frontpage banner.         | $banner-height       | 75vh                           | 100vh        |

There are many more already available. These will be documented over time.
